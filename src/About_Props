Props is a short term for "properties"

Main usage is pass from a parent component to a child component. This makes
react components reusable.
Write the code once then Reuse it.
These are read only and cannot be modified within the child component.
From this we can reuse the same code again and again.
props are passing from top to bottom.

When you using props with class functions then you have to 
use this.props term. This happend when you use class components only.
In React, class components are a way to create and manage components 
using ES6 classes. Class components were the primary way of creating 
components in React before the introduction of hooks with React 16.8.
 Though hooks have gained popularity and are now the recommended way 
 to write components, class components are still valid and can be 
 found in legacy codebases or projects that have not yet migrated to 
 using hooks.
